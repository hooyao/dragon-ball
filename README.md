# Dragon Balls

This little project is some experiments of distributed algorithms.

## Distributed File System

This simple implementation demonstrate the principles of a distributed block storage file system.
It employs Reed-Solomon algorithm and dynamic sharding.

Non-clustered redis storage servers are used as the backend.
